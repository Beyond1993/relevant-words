Thank you so much for chatting with you, I learn a lot from the interview.

The biggest challenge for me about this test is how to find the phrase. Firstly, I want to search in the dictionary to verify the phrase or use the 3rd NLP library such as Apache OpenNLP.
However, it would take more than two hours, so I used a simple solution, which is combining every tow and three words as phrase, Because the frequency of invalid phrase must be small.

I really cherish this interview opportunity, because it might be my first job ! I know my performance might not be good enough.
If you think I have a potential opportunity, is it possible to offer me an unpaid internship first? I will try my best to do it!
